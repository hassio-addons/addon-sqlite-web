Explore your Home-Assistant database from your web browser!

## About

This enables you to easily explore all tables and content that is saved in your database.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "SQLite Web" add-on.
1. Start the "SQLite Web" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "SQLite Web" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Click "OPEN WEB UI" to open the SQLite Web interface.
1. Log in with your Home Assistant user.

**NOTE**: Starting the add-on might take a couple of minutes (especially the
first time starting the add-on).

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "database_path": "home-assistant_v2.db",
  "read_only": true,
  "datasette": false,
  "ssl": true,
  "certfile": "fullchain.pem",
  "keyfile": "privkey.pem"
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and past it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `database_path`

The path for the database file relative to `/config/`

### Option: `read_only`

Open the database in read only mode if `true`.
**It is not recommended setting this to `false`,
this will enable you to corrupt the database!**

### Option: `datasette`

This option enables the optional service [Datasette]
that can serve as an API to your DB.
This endpoint will be exposed to port `6220`

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface of SQLite Web. Set it `true`
to enable it, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Hass.io_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Hass.io_
